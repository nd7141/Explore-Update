Explore-Update Python Repository
===================


This folder includes Python code for algorithms used for PIMUS problem. There are 3 python files: one containing algorithms, and 2 others auxiliary files. 

In file **run_data.py** there are several algorithms presented. 

- Explore-Update
- Greedy
- Top-Edges
- Top-Nodes
- Brute-Force

Additionally, **run_data.py** has routines to calculate spread given a feature spread. 

In file **prepare_data.py** there are routines to:

- Convert indexes of nodes to the correct format.
- Assign probabilities on the edges according to MV and WC models.
- Write communities and node memberships to the files. 

In file **visualise_data.py** there are methods to:

- Relationship plotting (with or without double y-axis)
- Bar plotting (with or without double y-axis)
